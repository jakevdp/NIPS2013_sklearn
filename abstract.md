Scikit-learn is an increasingly popular machine learning library written in Python.  It is designed to be both 
simple and efficient, useful to both experts and non-experts, and reusable in a variety of contexts.  The 
primary aim of the project is to provide a compendium of efficient implementations of classic, well-established 
machine learning algorithms with a consistent and elegant API. Among other things, it includes implementations 
of classical supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, tools for model evaluation and selection, as 
well as tools for preprocessing and feature engineering. Scikit-learn is distributed under the 3-clause 
BSD license, encouraging its free use in both commercial and academic settings.

Scikit-learn leverages the standard tools of the Scientific Python universe, including NumPy for efficient 
storage and manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays, SciPy for more specialized data structures 
(e.g. sparse matrices) and implementations of lower-level scientific algorithms, and Matplotlib for 
dynamic data visualization in two and three dimensions.

This presentation will include demonstrations of some of the most powerful and popular algorithms in the 
scikit-learn package.
